## Description
For the third part of the project, we created a script that allows a user to make various queries on our database using various queries. The script can be run automatically, or be interactive. The interactive script allows 5 types of options:
1. Search for a person (SELECT)
2. Add a new course (INSERT)
3. Delete an enrollment record (DELETE)
4. View a course's syllabus (JOIN)
5. View a student's gradebook (NESTED QUERY)
6. Load an interacive SQL console

## Execution
To run the interactive prompt, execute `python main.py`.

To run the automated script, execute `python main.py auto`.

## Dependencies
`sqlite3`
